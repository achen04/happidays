# happiDays
This chrome extension is made by Annie Chen and Matt Policane.

happiDays allows users to input text describing happiMoments of their day.

The bottom feed shows the user's past happiMoments along with the date.

The top feed shows posts from the community along with a happiButton for users to click on and
vote for. Each community post has a happiPoints. The more clicks on the happiButton, the more happiPoints.

Created during Facebook London Hackathon.
